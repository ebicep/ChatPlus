- Added disable chat window option. (Chat Window > General > Disabled)
- Removed (Chat Windows/Tabs > Enabled) option. To achieve the same effect, disable the chat window, hide chat tabs, and use the default `All` tab (which is default created when
  creating a new window). AKA, use below regex.
- Made `(?s).*` or `(.*?)` skip the regex matching stage, improving performance. They will now match everything.
- Fixed commands rendering behind the chat box.
- Fixed Max Command Suggestions config option not working.
